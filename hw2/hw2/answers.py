part1_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**<br />
**a. Output of layer is x*W^T+b. Shape of partial derivative is shape of W^t which is 512x1024** <br />
**b. W is sparse if it's initialized using a normal distribution with low std dev**<br />
**c. This is a linear transformation thus Jacobian of transformation w.r.t X is W^T. No need to explicitly calculate it.**<br />
Same process for derivative by W:<br />
**a. Shape of parital derivative of transformation w.r.t W is the shape of X which is 64x512**<br />
**b. X is sparse depending on the input. Not necessary for the model to learn efficiently, as opposed to W**
**c. The derivative w.r.t to W is X itself, as seen in implementatoin of linear layer, and therefore no need to calculate Jacobian explicitly.**

part1_q2 = r"""
**Your answer:**

Backpropegation is not the only method of training neural networks. It is the most commonly used because in most classification tasks the output is a scalar and thus the gradients can be explicitly and  efficiently calculated.

In all models there must be some objective function that is minimized, not necessarily through backpropegation.
